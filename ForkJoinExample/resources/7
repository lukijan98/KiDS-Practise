Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers".[note 1] Servers are a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice chat channels. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of July 21, 2019, there are over 250 million users of the software.
The concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games. He sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million,[10] which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012.[11] Their first product was Fates Forever, released in 2014, which Citron anticipated to be the first MOBA game on mobile platforms, but it did not become commercially successful.[12]
According to Citron, during the development process, he noticed how difficult it was for his team to work out tactics in games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends using available voice over IP (VoIP) software. This led developers to develop a chat service with a focus on user friendliness with minimal impact to performance.[12]
To develop Discord, Hammer & Chisel gained additional funding from YouWeb's 9+ incubator, which had also funded the startup of Hammer & Chisel, and from Benchmark capital and Tencent.[11][13]
Discord was publicly released in May 2015 under the domain name discordapp.com.[14] According to Citron, they made no specific moves to target any specific audience, but subreddits were replacing their IRC links with Discord links.[15] Discord became widely used by esports and LAN tournament gamers. The company benefited from relationships with Twitch streamers and subreddit communities for Diablo and World of Warcraft.[16]
In January 2016, Discord raised an additional US$20 million in funding including an investment from WarnerMedia.[17] In 2019, WarnerMedia Investment Group sold its share as it was shut down following AT&T's acquisition of WarnerMedia.[18][19]
Microsoft announced in April 2018 that it will provide Discord support for Xbox Live users, allowing them to link their Discord and Xbox Live accounts so that they can connect with their Xbox Live friends list through Discord.[20]
In December 2018, the company announced it raised $150 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation. The round was led by Greenoaks Capital with participation from Firstmark, Tencent, IVP, Index Ventures and Technology Opportunity Partners.[21]
In March 2020, Discord changed its motto from "Chat for Gamers" to "Chat for Communities and Friends", and introduced server templates. This was part of their response to an increase of users as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[22][23]
In April 2020, Discord's Twitter username was changed from @discordapp to @discord.[24] Later in May 2020, Discord changed its primary domain from discordapp.com to discord.com.[25]
Starting in June 2020, Discord announced it was shifting focus away from video gaming specificity to a more all-purpose communication and chat client for all functions, revealing its new slogan "Your place to talk" and a revised website. Among other planned changes would be to reduce the number of gaming in-jokes it uses within the client, improving the user onboarding experience, and increasing server capacity and reliability. The company announced it had received an additional US$100 million in investments to help with these changes.[26]
In March 2021, Discord announced it had hired its first finance chief, former head of finance for Pinterest Tomasz Marcinkowski. This is considered, by a person familiar with the company's plans, to be one of the first steps for the company towards a potential initial public offering, though co-founder and CEO Jason Citron stated earlier this month he is not thinking about taking the company public. Discord doubled its monthly user base to about 140 million last year.[27] The same month, Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft and other potential companies were looking to purchase Discord at a value estimated at $10 billion.
Discord is built to create and manage private and public communities. It gives users access to tools focused around communication services like voice and video calls, persistent chat rooms, and integrations with other gamer-focused services along with the general ability to send direct messages and create personal groups.[29] Although at first, Discord services seem directed towards only gamers, in recent years, it has brought several new updates, making it more useful for the general population.
The desktop, web, and mobile apps all use React, using React Native on iOS/iPadOS and Android.[2] The desktop client is built on the Electron framework using web technologies, which allows it to be multi-platform and operate as an installed application on personal computers.[54]
Discord uses the metaphors of servers and channels similar to Internet Relay Chat even though these servers do not map to traditional hardware or virtual servers due to its distributed nature.[note 1] They are instead database entities in Discord's servers. 
All versions of the client support the same core feature set; screen sharing with desktop audio is Windows exclusive, as is downloading and playing games from the Discord Game Store. Discord is specifically designed for use while gaming, as it includes features such as low-latency, free voice chat servers for users and dedicated server infrastructure. Support for calls between two or more users was added in an update on July 28, 2016.[citation needed]
The software is supported by eleven data centers around the world to keep latency with clients low.[55]
Discord uses the Opus audio format, which is low-latency and designed to compress speech.[56]
Discord's backend is written mostly in Elixir,[3] Python,[4] as well as Rust,[5][6] Go, and C++.
